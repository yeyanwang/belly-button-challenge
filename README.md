# belly-button-challenge

### Descripton

build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](https://github.com/yeyanwang/belly-button-challenge/blob/main/data/samples.json) (you can also locate it in `data/samples.json`), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
